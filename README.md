# Scraper for Hong Kong Public Records Office Online Catalogue

## Description
This is a Javascript + jQuery scraper for quickly downloading search results from the Online Catalogue of the Public Records Office, a functionary of the Hong Kong SAR Government's Government Records Service. This code only collects public information that is openly accessible through the Online Catalogue, and its sole purpose is to help researchers accelerate the process of browsing and downloading such information in tabular format.

## How to use
Please consider contacting litienyi@mit.edu for a demonstration. To summarize in writing:
1. Go to the [Online Catalogue webpage](https://search.grs.gov.hk/en/index.xhtml). 
2. Enter and submit your query (type in keywords and press search). 
3. Add filters as necessary.
4. Open your browser console. (Command+Option+J for Google Chrome on Mac)
5. Paste scraper.js into your console.
6. Replace url0 in Line 1 of code with the URL of search results page.
7. Press enter to run code.
8. The word "done" will keep spawining in your console in batches. Wait until this process stops. The process should take a few seconds to up to a minute.
9. Type console.log(table) in your console. Press enter to submit. A table with your results should appear.
10. Copy this table into a Markdown (.md) file or into Excel for further perusal.

### **CAUTION**
Depending on your device's computing power, scraping too many results may crash your computer. Please save all your work before running this script. For your reference, my M1 MacBook Pro comfortably handled 1000 results and crashed when trying 23,000 results.
